Wish You Were Here

So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from hell,
Blue skies from pain.
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail,
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts,
Hot ashes for trees,
Hot air for a cool breeze,
A cold comfort for change?

Did you exchange
A walk-on part in a war
For a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here.
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year.
Running over the same old ground
And how we found the same old fears
Wish you were here.
